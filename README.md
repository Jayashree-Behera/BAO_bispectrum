### Abstract

We investigate how well a simple leading order perturbation theory model of the bispectrum can fit the baryon acoustic oscillation
(BAO) feature in the measured bispectrum monopole of galaxies. Previous works showed that perturbative models of the galaxy
bispectrum start failing at the wavenumbers of k âˆ¼ 0.1 h Mpcâˆ’1. We show that when the BAO feature in the bispectrum is
separated, it can be successfully modelled up to much higher wavenumbers. We validate our modelling on GLAM simulations
that were run with and without the BAO feature in the initial conditions. We also quantify the amount of systematic error due to
BAO template being offset from the true cosmology. We find that the systematic errors do not exceed 0.3 per cent for reasonable
deviations of up to 3 per cent from the true value of the sound horizon.
